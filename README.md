## Running Locally

```bash
# install deps
npm install

# start dev server (light mode by default)
npm run dev    # http://localhost:5001/

# build production bundle
npm run build  # outputs to dist/

# preview the built site locally
npm run preview  # http://localhost:4173/
```

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

This repo uses the `gh-pages` workflow:

- `main` branch: your source code
- `gh-pages` branch: the built static site that GitHub Pages serves

Current scripts in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
  }
}
```

Deploy with:

```bash
npm run deploy  # predeploy runs automatically, then dist/ is pushed to gh-pages
```

### GitHub Pages Settings

- Repository: `brijeshvgiri/brijeshvgiri.github.io`
- Pages â†’ Source: "Deploy from a branch"
- Branch: `gh-pages` (root)

After deploying, your site is available at:

- https://brijeshvgiri.github.io/

## Notes

- You don't need to push `main` to update the live site; `npm run deploy` pushes the built files directly to `gh-pages`.
- If you see 404s after a rename, give Pages a few minutes to propagate and hard refresh the browser (Shift+Reload).
