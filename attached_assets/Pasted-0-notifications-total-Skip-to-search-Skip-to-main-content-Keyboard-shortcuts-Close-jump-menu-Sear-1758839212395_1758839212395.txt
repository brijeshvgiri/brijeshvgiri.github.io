AboutAbout
I’m a Computer Science graduate student at Northeastern University, passionate about building scalable, high-performance systems. With experience in full-stack development, cloud computing, and software architecture, I enjoy tackling challenging real-world problems through technology.

With 3+ years of experience in software engineering, I have worked across backend, frontend, database, DevOps, and cloud technologies, developing robust APIs, Microservices, and data pipelines. I have optimized large-scale systems, enhanced database performance, and automated CI/CD workflows to improve efficiency and scalability. I have a deep appreciation for software design principles and architecture patterns, including MVC, MVVM, and microservices, ensuring clean, maintainable, and scalable code. My work also includes applying machine learning and AI-driven solutions to solve complex problems.

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring new tech, solving puzzles, or enjoying a game of chess.

I kind of disagree with the point about tailoring to the team’s tech stack. Many companies only allow one active resume at a time and hyper-tailoring could potentially hurt by disqualifying you from roles in other teams by the ATS. Also, in many instances the team might not mention their tech stack upfront. And realistically, you can’t tweak your resume for every single role. I kind of don't have a solution to this, but just hoped to raise a point.
